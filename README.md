# AI-Powered-Survey-Insight-Tool
 Project Description:
The AI-Powered Survey Insight Tool is a full-stack web application designed to simplify survey creation, distribution, and analysis.
It empowers businesses to collect user feedback and extract deep insights using OpenAI’s GPT models for natural language processing.

This system integrates traditional form-based survey logic with artificial intelligence, allowing automated summarization, sentiment analysis, 
and suggested improvements based on open-ended responses. The result is faster, more intelligent decision-making based on real customer feedback.
